# Example App for the Scanbot Compose Multiplatform Barcode Scanner

This example app demonstrates integrating the Scanbot Compose Multiplatform Barcode Scanner SDK into your Kotlin Multiplatform project.

## What is the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK?

The Scanbot [Barcode Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites) is a simple and intuitive SDK that allows you to turn mobile devices into fast and reliable barcode scanners.

The SDK utilizes your device's camera, which can be freely switched. You can also apply various filters to narrow down the results by barcode type or content, with regex pattern support to ensure you only capture the specific barcodes relevant to your application.

It operates entirely offline on the user's device and takes only 0.04 seconds to scan barcodes. Scans are accurate even under challenging conditions, including damaged, small, or distant barcodes and low-light environments.

The SDK can be integrated into your mobile apps within minutes and comes with Ready-To-Use UI components, which allow you to customize the barcode scanner to your needs.

ðŸ’¡ For more details about the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK, please check out our [documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/compose/introduction/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites).

## How to run this example app?

Ensure your environment is configured to run Kotlin Multiplatform applications. For setup instructions, see [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-setup.html).

To download and add the latest `ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK` XCFramework to the example app, run the following commands in the project root directory:

```
cd scripts
./setup_iosApp.sh
```

Alternatively, you can follow the [manual setup guide](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/compose/detailed-setup-guide/installation/#ios) for iOS.

Open the project in Android Studio and run it on Android/iOS.

## Features of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK

### Out-of-the-box barcode scanning workflows

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK offers the following scan modes right out of the box in our ready-to-use user interfaces: 

#### Single Scanning

This is the Barcode Scanner SDK's default scanning mode. It is optimized for detecting a single barcode at a time and is easily configurable to your needs. You can show a confirmation screen after the scan.

#### Batch & Multi Scanning

The barcode scanner can also be configured to scan multiple barcodes in succession (without closing the scanning screen every time), to capture more than one barcode from the camera view at once, or to count the scanned items.

#### Find & Pick

Given one or more barcodes, the Barcode Scanner SDK will visually highlight and scan the correct items for your users.Â It automatically selects the barcode with the right barcode value from your camera feed.

### AR Overlay

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK includes an optional AR Overlay for all scanning modes. A customizable frame and text highlight recognized barcodes, clearly distinguishing scanned from unscanned items. Users can select barcodes manually by tapping or instead rely on automatic selection.

### Scanning barcodes from an image

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK also supports still images, enabling barcode and QR Code scanner functionality for JPG and other image files. It supports single-image and multi-image detection and returns a list with the recognized barcodes.

### Supported barcodes

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK supports all common 1D- or 2D barcode formats, such as QR codes or Data Matrix codes, as well as multiple postal symbologies, including:

| Barcode type       | Barcode symbologies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
